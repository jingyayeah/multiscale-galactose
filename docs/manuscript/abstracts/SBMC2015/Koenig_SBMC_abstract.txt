We present a multi-scale model of liver galactose metabolism bridging the scales from single-cell metabolism over the tissue level to the whole-organ. The model combines a detailed kinetic model of the cellular galactose metabolism with a tissue-scale perfusion model of the sinusoid. The metabolic capacity of the whole liver is modelled by integrating the heterogeneous contribution of sinusoids differing in blood-flow rates and tissue-architecture. The model was applied to the normal physiological state and to different variants of galactosemia caused by deficiency of the galactokinase (GALK), galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), or UDP-galactose 4Â´-epimerase (GALE). The presented multi-scale model reproduces a wide range of experimental data ranging from multiple-indicator dilution and galactose elimination curves on organ and tissue scale, to alterations in key metabolites observed in galactosemia.

A) Schema of the tissue-scale model of hepatic metabolism consisting of diffusion and convection based transport of substances in the blood, diffusion-based transport of substances in the space of Disse and detailed kinetic model of metabolism on the cellular level (Figure 2). Galactose metabolism was included in the sinusoid-scale model with exchangeable metabolites between the cells and the space of Disse.
