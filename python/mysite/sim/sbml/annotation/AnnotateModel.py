Handle the XML annotations and notes for SBML and SEDML.
A general problem is annotate all the objects in the SBML and SEDML file.

Provide an easy format to handle the problem.

define annotation for XPath (RDF or SBO)
get SBase(s) for XPath, i.e. get all the sbml ids related to the XPath and get the SBase objects via the ids
write annotations to SBase objects
Do the same for notes.
