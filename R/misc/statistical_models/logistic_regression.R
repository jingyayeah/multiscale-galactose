# In statistics, deviance is a quality of fit statistic for a model that is 
# often used for statistical hypothesis testing. 
# It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals 
# in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood.

# Application to GEC prediction to discriminate between healthy and disease person.
# - Use the trainings dataset to fit the model
# - Use the model to predict the dataset
# - Cross-Validation

# On the other hand use the personalized GEC prediction for cutoff, i.e. define the best cutoff quantile 
# via the trainingsset.




# logistic regression predicts probabilities

# Select suitable cutoff
