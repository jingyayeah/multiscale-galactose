\title{Creates approximation data matrix for time and data vectors.}
\usage{
createApproximationMatrix(x, ids, simIds, points, reverse = FALSE)
}
\description{
Necessary to create a compatible data structure which has values
for all timepoints. Filling the gaps in the variable timestep solutions
from different integrations via linear interpolation of the available
datapoints for the given components.
}
\details{
if reverse=FALSE => fit time vector
if reverse=TRUE => fit data vector
}
